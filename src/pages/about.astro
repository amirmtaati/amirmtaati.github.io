        I'm Amir. I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, and Linux. I like understanding how things work and thinking through problems with care.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I value clarity, simplicity, and doing things with intention. I try to live a simple, deliberate, and meaningful life.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of writing, I enjoy reading, biking, walking, and having deep conversations with friends.

      <p>
        This is my digital gardenâ€”a place to collect and share what I'm learning and thinking about.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You'll find posts on programming, Emacs, Linux, and computer science, as well as longer essays on ideas that matter to me. There's also a section for short notes and aphorisms.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Everything here is a work in progress.

        A note on authenticity: Everything on this website is written by me (a human). While I use AI tools for basic spelling and grammar checks, all content, ideas, and writing are entirely human-authored.
