* About Me
Hi, I’m Amir Mohammad. I'm a first year *electrical engineering* student. I’m passionate about *computer science*, *mathematics*, and building things from scratch.

I first got into programming out of curiosity, and over time I discovered a love for both the theory and practice of computing. Studying /combinatorics/, /algorithms/, and /data structures/ in highschool also helped me discover my passion for mathematics and computer science. I enjoy *low-level programming*, working with languages like *C* and *Go*, and experimenting with compilers, chess engines, and creative tools. Alongside coding, I enjoy reading books, meditating, and taking long walks.

My greatest passions are learning, building, and sharing. This blog is where I document my journey in CS, reflect on what I discover, and share projects and ideas that excite me.
