## Introduction

Have you ever witnessed something raw and beautiful disappear and melt away before your eyes? This is what happened to me when we built walls around our garden ten years ago—and it taught me a profound lesson about what we truly lose when we choose separation over connection.
We had—still have—this piece of land in the countryside. We had just bought it, and the nature was wild and alive. There were trees and animals everywhere. Our land was right next to other properties, and you couldn't really tell where our land finished and theirs started. But it wasn't a problem. We saw our neighbors, talked, laughed, and shared fruits from our trees. Everybody knew each other. Everybody saw each other. As a little child, I felt pure freedom and connection—both with the people around us and with Nature itself.


## Here Comes The Wall[^1]

Soon after we moved in, all our neighbors started to fence their land. Little by little, those simple fences turned into long, imposing walls. Out of conformity—and perhaps fear of being left out—we decided to do the same thing. We started building walls around our garden with large, gray-colored concrete bricks.
As a little child, I witnessed the whole process, and to be honest, it was quite painful to watch. We cut down the trees that had grown for decades, took out their ancient roots, and replaced all that living beauty with soulless blocks of concrete.
Now, whenever I go there, the first thing I see are those walls. Only after getting through the wall do I get to see the garden beyond. There are still some trees there. Birds still come and sing, and the sky is the same brilliant blue. But something fundamental isn't quite the same anymore.
Nature does not feel alive like it used to. I don't see our neighbors, and I don't even know most of the new ones! Since we built those walls, we're all hiding behind them, avoiding each other, living in our separate little kingdoms.


## The Deeper Truth

But here's what I've come to realize over the years: the walls we built around our garden were just the beginning. They became a symbol of something much larger happening in our world today.
Think about it—isn't this exactly what we're doing everywhere? We build walls around our hearts, around our communities, around our countries. We retreat behind the safety of our smartphones, our gated communities, our social media echo chambers. We've become absolute experts at building barriers.
Just as we cut down those living trees that had grown for decades, we're cutting down relationships that took years to cultivate. We're replacing authentic human connections with artificial boundaries. The gray concrete blocks in my garden are no different from the invisible walls we create between ourselves and strangers, between us and those who think differently from us.


## The Questions We Must Ask

<Summary>
We desire to own, acquire, and dominate everything around us. But in the process of domination, we lose our most precious gift—our connection with ourselves, with Nature, and with each other.
</Summary>

What were we trying to accomplish with these walls? To signal others that this land is mine? Don't come close? In the process of protecting our so-called privacy, we lost our connection with our neighbors. But I wonder—is it really privacy we're seeking, or are we just hiding behind these walls out of fear?
We wanted privacy, security, and convenience. Yet all we got from cutting down those trees was destroying nature and losing our connection with the people around us. Maybe we were just trying to signal to the world: "Stay away from me! This land is mine! I OWN here!"
We desire to own, acquire, and dominate everything around us. But in the process of domination, we lose our most precious gift—our connection with ourselves, with Nature, and with each other.


## The Path Forward

What should be done, you might ask? Well, I don't have all the answers, and we certainly cannot change how others think and behave. But we can look to ourselves and choose to change our own hearts and actions.
Why not be kinder to Nature? Can't we learn to enjoy it without trying to own it, dominate it, and reshape it to our will? And why not extend that same kindness to our fellow human beings?
The biggest lesson that trees teach us is to be kind, gentle, and generous with one another. Yet too often, we act selfishly toward them—and toward each other. Trees in a forest don't compete for dominance the way we do. Instead, they share resources through their interconnected root systems, understanding that their survival depends entirely on the health of the entire forest.
What if we learned to live like that?


## Closing - A Call to Remember

<Summary>
every wall we build—whether made of concrete or fear, whether around our gardens or around our hearts—separates us not just from nature, but from the very essence of what makes us human: our infinite capacity to connect with something greater than ourselves.
</Summary>

My friends, every wall we build—whether made of concrete or fear, whether around our gardens or around our hearts—separates us not just from nature, but from the very essence of what makes us human: our infinite capacity to connect with something greater than ourselves.
By connecting to nature, we connect to ourselves. By connecting to ourselves, we connect to others. And by connecting to others, we remember that we are all part of the same living ecosystem—human and natural, beautifully intertwined and interdependent.
The trees I watched fall ten years ago are gone forever. So are some of the friendships that disappered when we stopped seeing each other over those walls. But the lesson they left behind remains crystal clear: true security doesn't come from walls that divide us—it comes from roots that connect us.
The choice is ours to make. We can continue building walls, or we can start building bridges. We can choose separation, or we can choose connection.
What will you choose?
