# The Art of Markdown

Welcome to this guide on writing beautiful content with Markdown! This post will show you how to use various Markdown features to create engaging content.

## Text Formatting

Markdown makes it easy to format your text. Here are some examples:

- **Bold text** is great for emphasis
- *Italic text* adds a subtle emphasis
- ***Bold and italic*** for strong emphasis
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for outdated content
- `inline code` for technical terms

## Links and References

You can create [inline links](https://astro.build) easily. You can also create reference-style links like [Astro][1] which keeps the text cleaner.

- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered Lists

}

greet('World');
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```
