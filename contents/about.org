* About Me
Hi, I’m Amir Mohammad. I’m passionate about computer science, mathematics, and building things from scratch.

I first got into programming out of curiosity, and over time I discovered a love for both the theory and practice of computing. Studying combinatorics and algorithms in highschool also helped me discover my passion for mathematics and computer science. I enjoy low-level programming, working with languages like C and Go, and experimenting with compilers, chess engines, and creative tools. Alongside coding, I enjoy reading books, meditating, and taking long walks.

My greatest passions are learning, building, and sharing. This blog is where I document my journey in CS, reflect on what I discover, and share projects and ideas that excite me.
