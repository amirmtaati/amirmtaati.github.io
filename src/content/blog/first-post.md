# A Complete Guide to Markdown Features

Welcome to this comprehensive guide showcasing all the features of Markdown! This post is designed to demonstrate how to use Markdown in your Astro blog while adhering to the content collection schema.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It’s widely used for writing documentation, blog posts, and README files.

### Why Use Markdown?
