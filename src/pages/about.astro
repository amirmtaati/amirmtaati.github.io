						I'm Amir, an 18-year-old curious student from Iran, passionate about learning at the intersection of 
						electrical engineering, computer science, and mathematics.
					</p>

					<p>
						My journey began in childhood when I started creating web pages, which sparked a deep fascination 
						with how technology works at its core. Though I'm still a student without any formal work experience, 
						I've been programming for years and am driven by curiosity about the fundamental principles that govern 
						both hardware and software systems.
					</p>

					<p>
						Currently, I work primarily with <span class="text-gruvbox-green font-medium">Go</span>, 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-blue font-medium">C/C++</span>, and 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-purple font-medium">Julia</span>. I also dabble in 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-orange font-medium">Python</span>, 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-yellow font-medium">Bash</span>, and 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-aqua font-medium">Lua</span> when needed. 
						Each language teaches me something new about different approaches to problem-solving.
					</p>

					<p>
						What truly excites me is the convergence of disciplines. I'm deeply passionate about 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-green font-medium">electrical engineering</span>, even though I'm still 
						learning the basics. There's something beautiful about understanding how electrons move through 
						circuits, how signals propagate, and how we can harness these phenomena to build incredible systems.
					</p>

					<p>
						My technical interests span several interconnected areas:

						Being young and without professional experience has its advantages - I approach problems with fresh eyes 
						and am not constrained by "the way things are supposed to be done." I'm eager to learn from others 
						while also sharing what I discover along the way.
					</p>

					<p>
						Living in Iran presents both challenges and unique opportunities. While access to some resources 
						might be limited, it has taught me to be resourceful and to deeply understand the fundamentals 
						rather than relying on convenient abstractions. This constraint has actually made me a more 
						thoughtful learner and programmer.
					</p>

					<p>
						This blog serves as my learning journal and a way to share knowledge with others who are on 
						similar journeys. I write about programming concepts, mathematical insights, what I'm learning 
						about electrical engineering, and the process of learning itself. My posts range from technical 
						tutorials to reflective essays about curiosity and discovery.
					</p>

					<p>
						When I'm not coding or studying, you might find me exploring circuit simulations, working through 
						mathematical proofs, or reading about the history of computing and electrical engineering. 
						I'm particularly fascinated by how theoretical concepts translate into practical applications, 
						and I love writing about these connections.
					</p>

					<p class="text-gruvbox-fg1 font-medium">
						If you're interested in learning about these fields, mathematics, or programming - especially if you're also 
						early in your journey - I'd love to connect and learn together. Feel free to reach out through 
						the contact page!
