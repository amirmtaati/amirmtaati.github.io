        Hello! I'm Amir, a writer, thinker, and digital minimalist.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This blog is my digital gardenâ€”a place where I share thoughts, essays, and observations
        on various topics that interest me. The design reflects my philosophy: clean, minimal, 
        and focused on content.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe in the power of simplicity, both in design and in writing. My goal is to 
        communicate clearly without unnecessary embellishment.
      </p>
