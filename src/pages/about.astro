						I'm Amir, an 18-year-old from Iran who's passionate about computer science and the art of building 
						software that works well and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
					</p>

					<p>
						My journey with programming started years ago, and what keeps me engaged is the endless depth of 
						the field. From theoretical computation to hands-on system building, there's always something new 
						to discover or a more elegant way to solve a problem.
					</p>

					<p>
						I love working at different levels of abstraction. Sometimes I'm writing 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-green font-medium">C</span> code that gets as close to the metal as possible, 
						other times I'm exploring the beauty of functional programming with 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-purple font-medium">Racket</span>. When I need to build something practical and efficient, 
						I reach for <span class="text-gruvbox-blue font-medium">Go</span> or 
						<span class="text-gruvbox-orange font-medium">Python</span>.
					</p>

					<p>
						For scientific computing and numerical work, <span class="text-gruvbox-aqua font-medium">Julia</span> 
						has become a favorite—it strikes this perfect balance between high-level expressiveness and performance. 
						And when raw speed is non-negotiable, <span class="text-gruvbox-red font-medium">C++</span> is still hard to beat.
					</p>

								<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gruvbox-yellow mb-3">What I Work With</h3>
								<ul class="space-y-1 text-gruvbox-fg3">
									<li>• <strong>C</strong> — systems programming, getting close to the hardware</li>
									<li>• <strong>Go</strong> — building efficient, concurrent systems</li>
									<li>• <strong>Python</strong> — rapid prototyping and general scripting</li>
									<li>• <strong>Racket</strong> — exploring functional programming concepts</li>
									<li>• <strong>Julia</strong> — scientific computing and numerical analysis</li>
									<li>• <strong>C++</strong> — performance-critical applications</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gruvbox-blue mb-3">What Interests Me</h3>
								<ul class="space-y-1 text-gruvbox-fg3">
									<li>• Systems programming and low-level optimization</li>
									<li>• Building interpreters and compilers</li>
									<li>• Algorithm design and analysis</li>
									<li>• Scientific computing and numerical methods</li>
									<li>• Minimal, clean software design</li>
									<li>• Understanding how languages work under the hood</li>
								</ul>

					<p>
						My development environment reflects my philosophy: I use <span class="text-gruvbox-green font-medium">Emacs</span> 
						as my editor and <span class="text-gruvbox-blue font-medium">Linux (Debian)</span> as my daily driver. 
						I believe in tools that are powerful yet simple, workflows that are efficient without being complicated.
					</p>

					<p>
						What really excites me about computer science is how it combines abstract thinking with concrete results. 
						You can spend hours thinking about algorithm complexity or the elegant design of a programming language, 
						then turn around and build something that solves a real problem. That connection between theory and practice 
						is what keeps me engaged.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm particularly drawn to understanding how things work at a fundamental level. Whether it's implementing 
						a simple interpreter, optimizing a critical algorithm, or just figuring out why one approach is faster 
						than another, I find the process of digging deep and really understanding the mechanisms fascinating.
					</p>

					<p>
						Being based in Iran gives me a unique perspective on technology and problem-solving. Sometimes constraints 
						force you to be more creative, to really understand your tools rather than just using them. It's taught me 
						to appreciate simple, robust solutions and to always look for ways to do more with less.
					</p>

					<p>
						This blog is where I document what I'm learning, share tools and techniques I've found useful, and explore 
						ideas about programming and computer science. Sometimes I write about a specific technical problem I've solved, 
						other times about broader concepts or approaches that I find interesting.
					</p>

					<p class="text-gruvbox-fg1 font-medium">
						If you're interested in any of these areas, or if you're working on something cool and want to share ideas, 
						I'd love to hear from you. The best part of this field is the community of people who are curious about 
						how things work and excited to build better solutions.
